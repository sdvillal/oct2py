Oct2Py is a means to seamlessly call M-files and Octave functions from Python.
It manages the Octave session for you, sharing data behind the scenes using
MAT files.  Usage is as simple as:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> oc = oct2py.Oct2Py()
    >>> x = oc.zeros(3,3)
    >>> print(x, x.dtype)
    [[ 0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.]] float64
    ...

If you want to run legacy m-files, do not have MATLAB(TM), and do not fully
trust a code translator, this is your library.


Features
--------

- Supports all Octave datatypes and most Python datatypes and Numpy dtypes.
- Provides OctaveMagic_ for IPython, including inline plotting in notebooks.
- Supports cell arrays and structs with arbitrary nesting.
- Supports sparse matrices.
- Builds methods on the fly linked to Octave commands (e.g. `zeros` above).
- Nargout is automatically inferred by the number of return variables.
- Thread-safety: each Oct2Py object uses an independent Octave session.
- Can be used as a context manager.
- Supports Unicode characters.
- Supports logging of session commands.
- Optional timeout command parameter to prevent runaway Octave sessions.

Installation
------------
You must have GNU Octave 3.6 or newer installed and in your PATH.
On Windows, the easiest way to get Octave is to use an installer from SourceForge_.
You must have the Numpy and Scipy libraries installed.
On Linux, it should be available from your package manager.

To install Oct2Py, simply:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install oct2py


Documentation
-------------

Documentation is available online_.
